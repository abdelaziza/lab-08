## Lab Question Answers

Question 1: What is the phone number dialed in sample3.py?

Answer: The phone number dialed is 5055034455

Question 2: Describe your algorithm. Explain what each of these functions do: get_peak_frqs(), get_max_frq(), and get_number_from_frq().

Answer:
In get_peak_frqs(), we take two arrays of FFT frequencies - one high and one low - and we get the max of the tuple so that we have a peak frequency for high and low.

In get_max_frq(), we are simply using a comparator to figure out the highest frequency amplitude in an array.

In get_number_from_frq(), using the arrays of lower and higher frequencies, we get the number based off the dictionary in order to decode.
